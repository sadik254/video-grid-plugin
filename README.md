An approach to display videos on a WordPress site in a specific style

The initial release has 2 sections, a main section, and a favorite section. videos can be added in both sections from the admin panel. Also, you can add a title and subtitle for that specific video. 

The video can be displayed using 2 shortcodes that are described in the plugin section. 

In the front end, the video player displays 3 videos in a row and multiple columns. The player looks modern and on hover, it displays the title and subtitle. Also when the play button is clicked the video starts playing in full-screen mode.
